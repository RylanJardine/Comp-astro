This code numerically solves the 1D advection equation
using both an FTCS scheme and Lax method. It is currently
set for v=1 over the domain of x from 0 to 1 with nx=100
grid points. With timesteps of dt=0.5dx/v, plotted from
t=0 to t=1. With initial conditions of u=1 for 0.25<x<=0.75
and u=0 otherwise. However, all of these parameters can be changed
in the code to evaluate over more timesteps or change v etc.
At each timestep, the code outputs a snap file containg x and
u for both FTCS and lax methods.

The code itself can be compiled by typing make into the
terminal and then run using the command ./ftcs to run the code.
Finally the results can be plotted for selected timesteps
(which can be changed in the plotting routine 'plotter2.py')
by typing python plotter2.py into the terminal. This will
produce plots for both the FTCS and lax methods.
