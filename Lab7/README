This code numerically solves the 1D advection equation
using an FTCS scheme, Lax method as well as the upwind scheme and lax-wendroff method.
The code can be compiled usin the make file provided by typing make. The code can
then be run by simply using ./solve. The code is currently set for v=1
over the domain of x from 0 to 1 with nx=100 grid points. Timesteps of
dt=(c*dx)/v are used, where the value of the courant
condition c can be selected from the terminal and read into the program (note 0.5
should be the default input such that dt=(0.5*dx)/v).
The initial conditions are u=1 for 0.25<x<=0.75
and u=0 otherwise or sin(2*pi*x). The exact form of the initial condition can be
selected in the terminal. However, all of these parameters can be changed
in the code to evaluate over more timesteps or change v etc.
Furthermore each of the 4 solving methods is avaialaible to be selected in the
termial via prompting to choose a number from 1 to 4.

The resulting ouptut files
can simply be plotted using splash from the command 'splash snap_*'. Or conversely
using my python plotting routine 'plotter2.py', however it is worth noting that the last
snap file written may need to be manually selected for plotting using python. In order
to produce multiple plots on the same plot, one needs to run the code, renaming the
last snap file to save it and then run the code a second time for the next routine and finally plot
the two results on top of each other.
